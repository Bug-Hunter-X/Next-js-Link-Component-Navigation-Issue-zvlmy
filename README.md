# Next.js Link Component Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Next.js `Link` component when navigating to dynamic routes or routes with query parameters.  The issue is that the link might not work as expected, potentially resulting in a 404 error or unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description:
The provided `MyComponent` uses the `Link` component to navigate to a '/profile' route.  However, if '/profile' is a dynamic route or if it relies on query parameters, the navigation might fail.  The core problem often involves improper handling of the `href` prop in such cases.

## Solution:
The solution focuses on properly constructing the `href` prop to correctly handle dynamic segments and query parameters in the target URL.
